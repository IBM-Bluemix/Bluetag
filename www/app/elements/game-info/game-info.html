<h1 align="center">Welcome to BlueTag!</h1>
<div>
Is it a game, or a tool for finding old friends and making new ones?   That's up for you to decide.
<br></br>

BlueTag is similar to the old fashion game of "tag" or "hide and seek" - But on steroids and with the aid of Harry Potter's Marauder's map. This is how it works:
<br></br>

Install the BlueTag app, or just run it from a browser on your laptop, and sign-in using a Twitter, Gmail, or Linked-In id.     Now you are part of the game.  BlueTag keeps track of your location so  that others can tag you.  You are in control of how visible you are to others.
<br></br>


  
In BlueTag everyone is "it" and the goal is to tag as many people as you wan to.  
People participating in the game have a choice about how much they hide.   They can:
<ul> 
<li>choose not to hide at</li>
<li>only be visible to their contacts</li>
<li>only be visible by time of day</li>
<li>only be visible by location</li>
<li>only be visible upon request</li>
</ul>

You can tag someone when the are within 10 meters.   They will appear on your "near me" list and you simply press "tag"  After that they will appear in your Contacts list and you will appear in their Tagged By list.
<br></br>

The winners will be the people who tag the most people AND the people who are tagged most.
<br></br>

That's the basics! Have fun!
